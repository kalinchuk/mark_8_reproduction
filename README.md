# Mark-8 Minicomputer Reproduction

This repository contains schematics, PCBs, instructions and parts lists for the Mark-8 minicomputer reproduction build which can be found at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndWWRKyKPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndWWRKyKPk). The instructions and parts for most of the boards can be found at [https://bytecollector.com/archive/mark_8/My_Mark-8_Info/Mark-8_Construction/RE_Mark-8_Const-NEW.pdf](https://bytecollector.com/archive/mark_8/My_Mark-8_Info/Mark-8_Construction/RE_Mark-8_Const-NEW.pdf)

You can find the transcript of the interview with Jon Titus [here](/jon_titus_interview.txt).

## PCBs

Original Mark-8 PCBs are very rare. Therefore, if one has the desire to build a Mark-8, they need to use reproduction PCBs. I created reproduction PCBs from the layouts found in the construction manual and got a fabricater to fabricate a large quantity of them at a discount. If you're interested in a set, check out the [listing on www.kalinchuk.com](https://www.kalinchuk.com/product-page/mark-8-minicomputer-reproduction-pcb-set).

## Output Ports Board

The output board is used for outputting data from the computer. It's a fairly simple board mostly consisting of ICs.

### Jumpers

There is one jumper in the middle of the board that needs to be installed. The additional jumpers will need to be installed according to the needs. For example, "A" can be jumpered with "1" to make CPU port 1 be output port A on the specific board. This allows for a maximum of 7 output ports with two output port boards.

## Memory Board

The memory board accepts 32-1101 SRAM ICs but requires a minimum of 8 of them. Multiple memory boards can be installed into the Mark-8 computer and linked together.

### Bugs

Ensure that the 8 holes at the top of the board (going to the top connector) are not connected to GND with vias. Early versions of the reproduction PCBs will require those 8 holes to be drilled out.

### Jumpers

There is one jumper between IC33 and IC34. If this memory board is the first (and only) memory board to be installed, jumper the "0" position and the "A" positions. Additionally, select the correct memory block with the jumper positions above IC33. First memory board needs to jumper "0" to "A", "1" to "B", "2" to "C" and "3" to "D". If installing additional memory boards into the Mark-8, the jumpers would be different. Refer to page 6 of the Mark-8 construction manual for more details.

## Address Latch Board

The address latch board latches addresses specified by the end-user which are then relayed to the memory board.

### Bugs

In addition to the bugs specified on the official bugs sheet, IC8-IC11 pin 4 needs to be pulled up to +5v with a 1k ohm pull-resistor (ref: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn54ls193-sp.pdf).

### Jumpers

There are two jumpers that need to be installed. The larger jumper is not annotated on the parts layout sheet but the holes do exist for it.

## Input Multiplex Board

The input multiplex board controls all data flowing into the computer and data between memory and CPU.

### Bugs

In addition to the bugs specified on the official bugs sheet, older versions of this board had two fabrication issues.

The jumper on the right side is missing a hole. This is because the other side of the board does not have a pad. This can be fixed by drilling out a hole using a [#60 (1mm) drill bit](https://amzn.to/3Vpg0OW) and [chuck](https://amzn.to/3VcrNii). Alternatively, a jumper wire can be soldered directly onto the trace.

<img width="400" alt="Input Multiplex Board Bug 1" src="https://github.com/kalinchuk/mark_8_reproduction/assets/1035984/e66becf7-9a5b-4ff0-8597-1c15fe580064">

IC1 has one of the pins connected to a passing trace. This is a frabrication issue and can be fixed by cutting the connection with a utility knife or small grinder (carefully).

<img width="400" alt="Input Multiplex Board Bug 2" src="https://github.com/kalinchuk/mark_8_reproduction/assets/1035984/6bb94a66-c09a-4d28-9848-aba197156cb5">

### Jumpers

There are two official jumpers and one additional jumper which was noted on the bugs sheet.

## CPU Board

The CPU board contains the 8008 microprocessor and is the "brain" of the computer.

### Bugs

The bugs sheet on page 46 states that IC3 pin 4 can be connected to ground. Some boards may have experienced issues with the pin not being grounded.

### Jumpers

The board has two official jumpers as annotated on the parts layout sheet.

<img width="400" alt="CPU Board Jumpers" src="https://github.com/kalinchuk/mark_8_reproduction/assets/1035984/b1e379a0-a1d3-45f8-87de-cfc9e11c3b5d">


As mentioned in the Bugs section, I went ahead and connected IC3 pin 4 to ground by soldering it to the passing trace (since that trace is connected to ground).

### Notes

It's important to use a correctly sized heat sink for each voltage regulator otherwise they will burn out. The 5 volt regulator (U1) needs a heat sink with thermal resistance of 2.00°C/W or less. The -9 volt regulator (U2) needs a heat sink with thermal resistance of 10.00°C/W or less.

## Case

The original Mark-8 did not come with a case nor did it specify a recommended case. The case we will be building is a close replica of the one shown on the front page of the July 1974 Radio Electronics magazine.

<img width="653" alt="July 1974 Radio Electronics Case" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9734195e-fda3-4947-a3d6-508fe39edfbf">

It's made out of 100% aluminum frame and panels. All panels are 1/16" thick. The aluminum frame members are 1" x 1". All this metal adds quite a bit of weight to the case but it's very solid.

### Drawings

Below, you will find the rough drawings that were drawn up before the CAD files were created.

The first version of the rear panel has a fan cut-out and also ports for the power plug and switch.

### Fabrication Notes

The vertical members are CNC machined aluminum. Four are required for the case. It contains four threads per piece so be sure to select "threads" when ordering from a CNC service (such as PCBWay).

The horizontal members are also CNC machined aluminum and contain threads (select "threads" when ordering). There are two sizes of the horizontal members - one is 15-1/4" long and the other is 9" long. The case requires four of each size.

The front panel is 1/16" thick aluminum sheet metal. I spray painted mine with aqua (satin) paint.

The rear panel is 1/16" thick aluminum sheet metal. Version 1 contains an opening for a fan, power plug and switch. Version 2 is also contains openings for serial ports.

When ordering, make sure to select "CNC" for vertical and horizontal pieces and "sheet metal" for all others.

The remaining sides of the enclosure are standard 1/16" thick aluminum sheets cut to size. I use OnlineMetals.com for this.
* Side pieces are 10.0"x8.75", 1/16" thick (2)
* Top piece is 17.25"x11.0", 1/16" thick (1)
* Bottom piece is also 17.25"x11.0" but 1/8" thick (1)

To assemble the case, 48 #10-24 x 3/8" screws will be required.

### Additional Notes

The Mark-8 will fit quite well into the case but, due to the size of the frame members, the front panel lights will not line up exactly with the opening of the front panel. I think the front panel design will be modified in the future so that the opening is moved slightly left.

<img width="653" alt="Case Front Panel Opening" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/559f74b9-b434-4916-bbf8-920d83dd4208">

The power supply fights perfectly to the left of the Mark-8 computer. Additional pieces (i.e. power transformer, barrier strip, etc.) will fit in the remaining space. I also added a fan to the left of the power supply to cool it down since it gets quite hot.

## Original Case

The construction manual did not recommend a case for the Mark-8 minicomputer but the case that was used for the Mark-8 that was featured on the front cover of the Radio Electronics magazine was made by Bud Industries and had a part number of SB-2142. Those cases are still available for sale from various sources. The one I purchased was from https://www.testequity.com/product/10014392-SB-2142

### CAD Files

These CAD files are for the Bud Industries case. I have not tested them, personally, but the dimensions should be correct.
