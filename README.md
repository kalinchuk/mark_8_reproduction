# Mark-8 Minicomputer Reproduction

This repository contains schematics, PCBs, instructions and parts lists for the Mark-8 minicomputer reproduction build which can be found at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndWWRKyKPk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wndWWRKyKPk). The instructions and parts for most of the boards can be found at [https://bytecollector.com/archive/mark_8/My_Mark-8_Info/Mark-8_Construction/RE_Mark-8_Const-NEW.pdf](https://bytecollector.com/archive/mark_8/My_Mark-8_Info/Mark-8_Construction/RE_Mark-8_Const-NEW.pdf)

## PCBs

Original Mark-8 PCBs are very rare. Therefore, if one has the desire to build a Mark-8, they need to use reproduction PCBs. I created reproduction PCBs from the layouts found in the construction manual and got a fabricater to fabricate a large quantity of them at a discount. If you're interested in a set, check out the [listing on www.kalinchuk.com](https://www.kalinchuk.com/product-page/mark-8-minicomputer-reproduction-pcb-set).

## Note on Parts

- Any 74XX IC can be substituted with a 54XX (military grade) or, potentially, with a 74LSXX (Low-power Schottky).
- The Molex connectors that I used are the following:

## LED Register Display Board

The LED Register Display board is used for displaying the address and contents of memory and output ports. It consists of 32 LEDs (8 for the high address, 8 for the low address, 8 for the address data and 8 for the output data).

## Output Ports Board

The output board is used for outputting data from the computer. It's a fairly simple board mostly consisting of ICs.

### Jumpers

There is one jumper in the middle of the board that needs to be installed. The additional jumpers will need to be installed according to the needs. For example, "A" can be jumpered with "1" to make CPU port 1 be output port A on the specific board. This allows for a maximum of 7 output ports with two output port boards.

### Test Circuit

The test circuit was taken from the Mark-8 Construction Manual Experiments section.

The following code will output 10101010 to output port 1 (remember that output port 0 is on the LED register display).

## Memory Board

The memory board accepts 32-1101 SRAM ICs but requires a minimum of 8 of them. Multiple memory boards can be installed into the Mark-8 computer and linked together.

### Bugs

Ensure that the 8 holes at the top of the board (going to the top connector) are not connected to GND with vias. Early versions of the reproduction PCBs will require those 8 holes to be drilled out.

### Jumpers

There is one jumper between IC33 and IC34. If this memory board is the first (and only) memory board to be installed, jumper the "0" position and the "A" positions. Additionally, select the correct memory block with the jumper positions above IC33. First memory board needs to jumper "0" to "A", "1" to "B", "2" to "C" and "3" to "D". If installing additional memory boards into the Mark-8, the jumpers would be different. Refer to page 6 of the Mark-8 construction manual for more details.

### Test Program

The following code will output 10101010 to output port 0 (LED register display) to test the functionality of the memory board.

## Address Latch Board

The address latch board latches addresses specified by the end-user which are then relayed to the memory board.

### Bugs

In addition to the bugs specified on the official bugs sheet, IC8-IC11 pin 4 needs to be pulled up to +5v with a 1k ohm pull-resistor (ref: https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn54ls193-sp.pdf).

Early versions of the reproduction PCBs also have an additional bug - one of the vias is missing and needs to be drilled out and connected with a piece of wire.

### Jumpers

There are two jumpers that need to be installed. The larger jumper is not annotated on the parts layout sheet but the holes do exist for it.

## Input Multiplex Board

The input multiplex board controls all data flowing into the computer and data between memory and CPU.

### Bugs

In addition to the bugs specified on the official bugs sheet, older versions of this board had two fabrication issues.

The jumper on the right side is missing a hole. This is because the other side of the board does not have a pad. This can be fixed by drilling out a hole using a [#60 (1mm) drill bit](https://amzn.to/3Vpg0OW) and [chuck](https://amzn.to/3VcrNii). Alternatively, a jumper wire can be soldered directly onto the trace.

<img width="400" alt="Input Multiplex Board Bug 1" src="https://github.com/kalinchuk/mark_8_reproduction/assets/1035984/e66becf7-9a5b-4ff0-8597-1c15fe580064">

IC1 has one of the pins connected to a passing trace. This is a frabrication issue and can be fixed by cutting the connection with a utility knife or small grinder (carefully).

<img width="400" alt="Input Multiplex Board Bug 2" src="https://github.com/kalinchuk/mark_8_reproduction/assets/1035984/6bb94a66-c09a-4d28-9848-aba197156cb5">

### Jumpers

There are two official jumpers and one additional jumper which was noted on the bugs sheet.

## CPU Board

The CPU board contains the 8008 microprocessor and is the "brain" of the computer.

### Bugs

The bugs sheet on page 46 states that IC3 pin 4 can be connected to ground. Some boards may have experienced issues with the pin not being grounded.

### Jumpers

The board has two official jumpers as annotated on the parts layout sheet.

<img width="400" alt="CPU Board Jumpers" src="https://github.com/kalinchuk/mark_8_reproduction/assets/1035984/b1e379a0-a1d3-45f8-87de-cfc9e11c3b5d">


As mentioned in the Bugs section, I went ahead and connected IC3 pin 4 to ground by soldering it to the passing trace (since that trace is connected to ground).

## Backplane

The backplane is used for connecting all the boards together. The original Mark-8 did not have a backplane so all boards had to be manually connected with wires.
