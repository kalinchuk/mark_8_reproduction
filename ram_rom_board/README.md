# Mark-8 16K RAM/ROM Board

This RAM/ROM board for the Mark-8 minicomputer was designed by Len Bayles who, kindly, shared the Gerber file and documentation with me and helped me get familiar with it. Be sure to check out his website at [https://www.chronworks.com/](https://www.chronworks.com/).

This board will work with any reproduction Mark-8 minicomputer that uses a backplane with a 3.96mm pitch.

## Gerber

You can find the Gerber file under the "Gerber" directory. Be sure to credit Len Bayles if sharing publicly.

## Parts

The following parts list contains a suggested part number for each part but any comparable part will do.

Additionally, the board can be configured for RAM or ROM (or both). If using as RAM only, populate the SRAMs and leave the EPROMs out. If using as ROM only, populate the EPROMs and leave the SRAMs out. If using both RAM and ROM, populate both the EPROMs and the SRAMs.
